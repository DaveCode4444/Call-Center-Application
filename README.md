# Call-Center-Application
This application provides a solution to the object orietend design problem of Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition (7.3)

Problem: Call Center
Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, director. An incoming telephone call must be 
first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respodents can't handle call, he or shemust escalate the call to a manager. If the
manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design classes and data structures for this
problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns to the first available employee.
